                <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    More than 50% of students who registered on the platform each week abandoned it before having an "aha moment" that would allow them to experience Platzi's value proposition for the first time.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    This caused the Weekly Active Students (WAS) metric, which had been proven to have a direct relationship with conversion rate and retention rate, to stagnate and not grow.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Solution Approach</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Make adjustments to the onboarding process, where students could select a topic of interest at a general level (faculty) and then something more specific (school), in order to use this information to take them to content that fit what they were looking for.

                        If we give students the option to <strong>specifically search for the content</strong> they want, instead of a list of options, we will reduce time to value since they will see content quickly, which will impact WAS.
